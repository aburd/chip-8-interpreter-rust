## Description

This is a Chip-8 interpreter written in Rust.
This project is for study purposes and I am a beginner at emulation and Rust programming in general.

I was interested in emulation and had no idea where to start. After some research, it seems that Chip-8 is a nice starting point. The code will most likely be verbose. That being said, I hope it helps other beginners.

Happy coding :)
